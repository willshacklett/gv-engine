# gv-engine

A minimal, constraint-based engine for computing a single scalar strain score (GV-style)
and for experimenting with coupling between constraints in complex systems.

This repository contains only the core engine and experiments.
Applications (CI, scheduling, physics, simulations) should consume this as a dependency.
